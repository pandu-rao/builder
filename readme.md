builder
==========

Dockerized build system based on buildbot.

Ensure that a file called build.sh exists in the target repo.

See [identidock/build.sh](https://github.com/pandu-rao/identidock/blob/master/build.sh) for reference.

This build system will execute build.sh inside sibling docker containers.
